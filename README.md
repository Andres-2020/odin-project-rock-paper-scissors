# Calculator For The Odin Project

## Step by step

1. Created the **"_getComputerChoice_"** function which gets a random choice from the computer and returns "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors".
2. Created the **"_getPlayerChoice_"** function which gets a random choice from the player and returns "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" **and** is case-insensitive.
3. Created the **"_playerScore_"** and **"_computerScore_"** variables.
4. Created the **"_playRound_"** function which relies on the "_playerScore_" and "_computerScore_" values to play a single round of "Rock, Paper or Scissors" to declare a winner.
5. Created the **"_game_"** function which loops the "_playRound_" function until someone scores 5 points.
